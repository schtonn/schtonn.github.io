        John had always wanted to be rich, and he thought he had stumbled onto the easy way to do it. While visiting an old building, he had found a peculiar looking box. He figured that it must be an antique, and possibly, a valuable one. He decided that he would take the box, sell it, and buy himself a Mercedes.

        He took it home and placed it on his desk. He opened it up, but inside there was nothing except for a riddle written on a piece of paper. John was determined to solve it and unlock the hidden treasure he was sure was inside. He worked for hours trying to piece together the riddle, but he couldn’t make any progress.
        
        Finally, he decided to take a break and get some fresh air. While he was outside, he spotted a rusty old pipe sticking out from the ground. He went to investigate and discovered that if he unscrewed the pipe, there was a hollow chamber beneath it that held the key to the box! After excitement-filled moments of unlocking the box, John discovered it had been filled with jewelry and money all along.
        
        He suddenly realized that the riddle he had been trying to figure out was actually a clue meant to guide him to the true nature of the box’s contents! John was thrilled that his hunch had paid off and he was now a wealthy man thanks to his quick-witted thinking.
