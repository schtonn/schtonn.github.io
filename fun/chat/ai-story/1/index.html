    Once upon a time there was a lonely lighthouse keeper who spent his days tending to the beacon of light underneath the peaceful stars. He was a kind soul and every day sent out his endless prayers, in hopes of finding solace in the sea. 

    One day, a boat carrying a beautiful princess and her crew appeared around the lighthouse. When the light shone upon them, the princess's heart was filled with joy. She had left her kingdom to find the missing peace that she desperately sought. 
    
    The lighthouse keeper welcomed the princess and her crew with open arms, giving them a place to stay and a warm meal. As the days went by, the keeper put his heart and soul into making the princess feel at home. Soon, the princess's missing peace began to return, allowing her to share her story with her new friend. 
    
    Through their shared conversations, the keeper realized that the princess had been searching for something her entire life - a feather from the majestic Phoenix of the East. He understood that it was the key to restore her missing peace, and thus he decided to give her a parting gift of his own - a magical feather plucked from the rarest of birds to be found in the village nearby. 
    
    The next day, the princess and her crew sailed off with the lighthouse keeper's feather. When they arrived in the East, they quickly discovered the Phoenix of the East, and the princess was able to receive the true feather she had been looking for. 
    
    The princess returned home to her kingdom with peace in her heart, and she knew the lighthouse keeper was the one who had helped her gain the courage to keep searching. With renewed hope, the princess brought her newfound peace to the kingdom and all its people, leading to a beautiful future.
